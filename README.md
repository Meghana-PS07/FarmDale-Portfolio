## 🎯 Product Strategy Case Study: Making FarmDale Players Stay  

### Goal & Strategy Summary  
Our main job for FarmDale is to **get players to stick around longer**.  
When players keep coming back, the game makes more money and grows stronger.  

| **Goal** | **Target** | **Timeframe** |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Keep Players Playing (Retention) | 20% More Players Staying | Next 3 Months |

---

### 💡 Why This Goal Matters
- **More Money:** Players who stay longer are much more likely to spend money.  
- **Steady Growth:** Retention is cheaper than constantly finding new players.  
- **Clear Target:** Simple to measure with a defined deadline.

## 🔎 1. The Problem: Why Players Quit  

We can’t fix what we don’t measure. Using game data, we found the **churn points** (moments when players quit):  

- **Danger Zones:** Around **Level 10–15** and again at **Level 30–50**.  

### The 3 Main Problems  

| **Problem** | **What It Feels Like to the Player** | **Our Fix** |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Slow Game Pace | "It takes too long to unlock anything new. It's boring now." | Make it Faster |
| Too Many Things to Manage | "I have too many machines and not enough storage. It's confusing." | Make it Simpler |
| No Reason to Come Back | "My crops are done in 6 hours. I’ll just check tomorrow... maybe." | Make it a Habit |

## 🛠️ 2. The Solution: Our 5-Step Action Plan  

| **Step** | **What We Do** | **Why It Works (Focus)** |

| 2. Daily "Quick Wins" | Add Daily Reward Streak: instant perks (Day 1–3), exclusive decoration (Day 7) | Encourages daily login |
