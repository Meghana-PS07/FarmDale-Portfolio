Product Strategy Case Study: Making FarmDale Players Stay
Goal & Strategy Summary
Our main job for FarmDale is to get players to stick around longer. When players keep coming back, the game makes more money and grows stronger.

Goal	Target	Timeframe
Keep Players Playing (Retention)	20% More Players Staying	Next 3 Months


Why This Goal Matters:

More Money: Players who stay longer are much more likely to spend money on the game.

Steady Growth: Keeping players is cheaper than constantly finding new ones. It makes our business stable.

Clear Target: This goal is simple to measure and sets a clear deadline for the team.




1. The Problem: Why Players Quit
We can't fix what we don't measure. First, we use game data to find the exact moments players get bored and leave.

Finding the Churn Points
We track players at Day 7 and Day 30 to see who stays.

The Big Insight: Players are happy at the start, but many quit around Level 10-15 and then again between Level 30-50. These are the danger zones.

The 3 Main Problems
Problem	What It Feels Like to the Player	Our Fix
Slow Game Pace	"It takes too long to unlock anything new. It's boring now."	Make it Faster
Too Many Things to Manage	"I have too many machines and not enough storage. It's too confusing."	Make it Simpler
No Reason to Come Back	"My crops are done in 6 hours. I'll just check it tomorrow... maybe."	Make it a Habit

2. The Solution: Our 5-Step Action Plan
Our plan focuses on quick fixes to reward players and make the mid-game feel more fun and less stressful.

Step	What We Do	Why It Works (Focus)
1. Check the Score	We look at our starting retention numbers (the "baseline") to know how much we need to improve.	Set the starting point.
2. Give Daily "Quick Wins"	We add a simple Daily Reward Streak. Give small, instant perks (like faster crops) for Day 1-3, and a cool, exclusive decoration for checking in on Day 7.	Gives players a strong reason to log in every day.
3. Speed Up the Start	We cut the time/effort needed to finish Levels 1-15. We also give a free speed-up item right after the tutorial.	Helps new players see more features fast and get "hooked."
4. Use Short, Fun Events	We launch a 3-day "Village Festival." Players donate items to the event for a rare, limited-time prize.	Brings back bored mid-level players with a new, urgent goal.
5. Test and Learn	We use A/B Testing (showing different versions to different players) to see exactly which reward system works best.	Makes sure we are only implementing the best changes.

3. Expected Outcome
If we succeed, FarmDale will be a much stronger, more profitable game.

More Loyalty: Players will spend more time in the game and be more likely to stay for years, not weeks.

Higher Spending: Increased retention naturally leads to more opportunities for players to buy items and currency.

Stronger Base: We build a happy community that will tell their friends to play, helping the game grow naturally.
